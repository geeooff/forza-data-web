# Contributing to this project

Unfortunately I don't have enough time in my life to provide guidance, reviews of pull-requests or debate about any contribution you could make to this project.

Your pull request has so an high chance of not being merged, and I'm sorry for that.

**Be sure I still appreciate any feedback !**

This project will remain experimental on my side.

I will follow next Forza Horizon/Motorsport game releases with interest to see how I can support them after all.

**Thanks for reading me and for having forked my code !**
